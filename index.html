                <h2>2025-2027: Hostile Landscape & CCO Establishment</h2>
                <p>As the global digital landscape grows increasingly hostile with escalating state-backed cyber espionage and misinformation campaigns targeting Western democracies, Queensland establishes the Cyber Coordination Office (CCO).</p>
                <p>However, Queenslandâ€™s cybersecurity remains fragmented across government, industry and regions, creating systemic vulnerabilities at the seams of disconnected initiatives.</p>

            <p class="animated-item">The CCO initiative, designed to improve coordination, lacks the authority to mandate action or enforce unified standards across a government still rooted in siloed governance. Queensland's response to an evolving and aggressive global threat environment remains decentralized and vulnerable, failing to unify its defences against sophisticated, externally driven attacks.</p>

            <p class="animated-item">Queensland introduces the SSF (Security Standards Framework) to standardize security practices. Yet, this framework's voluntary adoption proves its undoing. Without legislative backing, it cannot compel disparate agencies to align. This occurs while global adversaries innovate with advanced persistent threats and supply chain attacks. Attempts to foster coordination, such as the Cyber Coordination Office (2027) and the Security Standards Framework (2029), ultimately failed to overcome these systemic barriers.</p>

                <h2>2030: Rapid Digital Integration, Persistent Silos</h2>
                <p>Queensland undergoes a rapid acceleration of digital integration across its economy and public services. Essential sectors like health, transport, and climate adaptation become deeply reliant on interconnected, real-time data systems, critical for community life.</p>
                <p>Queensland's economy in 2032 is a testament to digital integration and regional diversification. Government services, industry operations, and community life all critically depend on deeply connected systems. From health and transport to education and climate adaptation, everything relies on real-time data and interoperable platforms. Yet, the governance of these very systems remains fragmented by design, creating dangerous digital fault lines.</p>
                <p>Departmental lines rigidly shape infrastructure investment. Each portfolio deploys technology to serve its core functions, utterly devoid of a shared digital strategy or joint security protocols. While cross-agency services do exist, their back-end systems stubbornly remain siloed.</p>

            <p class="animated-item">Despite a rapid digital integration, the inherent fragmentation of cybersecurity governance persists rigidly. Security protocols remain divided by departmental lines, and cross-agency visibility is minimal. This internal disconnection, in an era of heightened global cyber warfare and critical infrastructure targeting, creates compounding vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p class="animated-item">When digital risks inevitably emerge, each organisation assesses and responds independently, operating in its own isolated bubble. This autonomy leads to wildly varying security maturity. Some departments and local councils maintain robust capabilities, while others operate with minimal safeguards, leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed.</p>

                <h2>2032 Overview: Olympics Loom, System Under Test</h2>
                <p>With the Brisbane Olympics just months away, global attention intensifies on Queensland. The impending Games represent an irresistible, high-profile target for sophisticated state and non-state actors, who keenly observe Queensland's departmental silos and inconsistent security postures.</p>
                <p>By 2032, Queensland's cybersecurity system is critically disconnected. This isn't the result of a single catastrophic event, but rather the cumulative effect of institutional inertia, short-term budgeting, contested authority, and a legacy of siloed governance. Fragmentation has become the default operating model. Security responsibilities remain stubbornly divided across departments, agencies, sectors, and jurisdictions. Despite widespread digital integration of services and systems, our governance simply hasn't kept pace.</p>
                <p>Each entity now operates its own security posture, with minimal visibility into others. Standards are inconsistent, incident response is fragmented, and information sharing is, at best, informal. Crucially, security investments are often reactive rather than strategic, frequently competing with frontline service priorities. As a result, public trust is increasingly fragile, with the quality of protection varying significantly across services and communities. The impending Brisbane 2032 Olympics presents the ultimate test, exposing the critical flaws of Queensland's deeply fragmented cybersecurity system. The Games become a prime target for adversaries.</p>

            <img src="images/fragmented-model-diagram-fx.png" alt="Fragmented Model Diagram FX" class="section-diagram animated-item">
            <p class="animated-item">Queensland's cybersecurity "model" isn't a deliberate strategy; it's simply an accumulation. Over time, departments and sectors independently built security functions, each aligned with their own mandates and budgets. Crucially, these functions were never integrated. Despite earnest attempts at cross-cutting coordination, they consistently failed to overcome entrenched resistance, significant cost constraints, and fiercely competing operational priorities.</p>
            <p class="animated-item">In practice, each agency manages its own security posture. This includes procurement, compliance, incident response, workforce and standards. Agencies differ widely in what they prioritise and how they measure success. Some align with international frameworks. Others operate informally or follow minimum legal requirements.</p>
            <p class="animated-item">The Cyber Coordination Office, created in 2027, lacked authority. It offered guidance but could not mandate action. Likewise, the Security Standards Framework (2029) was unevenly adopted. Without legislative backing, it became one of many competing references rather than a unifying instrument.</p>
            <p class="animated-item">There is no shared threat intelligence platform. Information sharing is voluntary and often delayed. Alerts are distributed through sectoral channels, with no central body compiling patterns or escalating systemic risks. Large agencies may have their own intelligence functions, but these rarely extend beyond their operational perimeter.</p>
            <p class="animated-item">Incident response varies. Each organisation has internal protocols. Cross-agency incidents trigger improvised coordination phone calls, email chains, temporary working groups. Exercises are rare, and there is no formal whole-of-government simulation program.</p>
            <p class="animated-item">Investment flows exclusively through departmental budgets, with no pooled funding for shared capabilities. Workforce planning occurs within deep silos, leading to frustratingly duplicated roles and critical talent gaps. Security expertise clusters around high-profile departments, while regional and remote offices are left to operate with minimal specialised support, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.</p>
